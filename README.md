## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Basic Dataset Setup
- Loaded the Students Performance dataset
- Checked for missing values, data types, and basic statistics
- Explored the first few rows of the dataset

### Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
- Calculated descriptive statistics (mean, max, min, etc.)
- Grouped data by grades to analyze performance trends
- Checked correlations between features

### Task 3: Data Visualization
- Created bar charts for average total score by grade
- Plotted histogram for weekly self-study hours
- Boxplot for attendance percentage vs total score
- Scatter plot for weekly self-study hours vs total score
- Derived insights on patterns and trends in student performance

### Task 4: Sentiment Analysis
- Analyzed sample student feedback using TextBlob
- Classified reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral
- Visualized sentiment distribution using a bar chart
- Gained insights into student satisfaction and learning experience

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- TextBlob
- Google Colab

## Dataset
- **Students Performance Dataset**  
  - Source: Kaggle (Public Dataset)
- **Sample Text Reviews** for Sentiment Analysis

## Insights Summary

1. Students with higher grades have higher average total scores.  
2. Most students study between specific hours per week, impacting their scores.  
3. Attendance positively correlates with performance.  
4. Sentiment analysis shows overall positive student feedback with some neutral and negative responses, highlighting areas of improvement.
